    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>These fluffy vegan pancakes are delicious! I have been making them for years, 
        and everyone that tries them wants the recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
            </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons white sugar
            </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons baking powder
            </li>
        <li>
            1 ¼ cups water

            </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon salt
            </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon oil
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center
            . Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil and water into flour mixture. </li>
        <li>Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy. </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip,
             then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
        <li>Serve with berries. </li>
            </ol>
